My edited copy of the Passion ZSH theme and iTerm color profile.
Really just stripped a bunch of stuff out to make it more suitable for
tight spaces in screencats.

- Removed git info
- Replaced full path info with alias if available
- Removed times

* justin.zsh-theme - Move to your $ZSH/themes directory and set ZSH_THEME="justin"
* Passion.itermcolors - Go to Profiles ➡ Colors and import as a color preset.
* Screencasts.json - Bigger fonts for screencasts. Go to Profiles ➡ And import as a profile. This already includes the itermcolors,so no need to import both.
